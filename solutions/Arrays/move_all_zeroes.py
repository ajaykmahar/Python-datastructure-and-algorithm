'''
Move all zeroes to end of array
Given an array of random numbers, Push all the
zeroâ€™s of a given array to the end of the array.
For example, if the given arrays is
{1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to
{1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}.
The order of all other elements should be same.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is number of elements in input array.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Method explained:

    # Traverse the array. If element
    # Encountered is non-zero, then
    # Replace the element at index
    # Increment 'count' by 1
    # Now all non-zero elements have been
    # shifted to front and 'count' is set
    # as index of first 0. Make all
    # elements 0 from count to end.
